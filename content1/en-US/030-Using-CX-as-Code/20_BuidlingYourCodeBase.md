## The Terraform Registry

The code snips we will be referencing for our configuration below can be found at the Genesys Cloud Terraform Registry.

Before we begin our code setup, we will take a brief walk through of the terraform registry which can be found **[Here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/MyPureCloud/genesyscloud/latest/docs).**


## Setting up your file structure

From here, we will be starting from scratch with two terraform scripts and how to get started with terraform. Below you will see two separate terraform files you will need to create.

Within VS Code create the following two files (you can right click within your explorer or select file and "create file"): 
1. Variables.tf
2. Main.tf

Copy the code snippit below and paste it into your Variables.tf file. Once copied over you will need to enter your Oauth client ID and secret with the information from the Oauth client you created in Genesys Cloud. 

You will also need to replace the **[AWS Region](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/aws-regions-for-genesys-cloud-deployment/)** (found in the **AWS region name** column in the linked article) with the AWS region your Genesys Cloud org resides in. You can determine your AWS region by referencing the URL you use to access your org (Example: if you login to your org at https://login.usw2.pure.cloud/, you will input us-west-2 in the AWS Region Name field below)

```
variable "oauthclient_id" {
  default = "OAUTH ID HERE"
}
variable "oauthclient_secret" {
  default = "OAUTH SECRET HERE"
}

variable "aws_region" {
  default = "AWS Region Name"
}
```

Copy the code snippit below and paste it into your Main.tf file. This code snip contains your Oauth reference, terraform providers and a resource to construct a routing skill. **If you are using the workshop org, replace the numbers within the skill resource with your assigned number. If you are using your own org, simply make sure this doesnt match an existing skill.**

```
terraform {
  required_version = "~> 1.2.6"
  required_providers {
    genesyscloud = {
      source  = "mypurecloud/genesyscloud"
      version = "~> 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "genesyscloud" {
  oauthclient_id = var.oauthclient_id
  oauthclient_secret = var.oauthclient_secret
  aws_region = var.aws_region
}

resource "genesyscloud_routing_skill" "test_skill" {
  name = "Workshop Skill 00"
}

```
## Running the Terraform Commands

Open up a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

![image](/images/CXTerminal.PNG)

In your terminal, you will run a series of four terraform commands. 

The first that you will need to run is: 

```
terraform version

```
**> Depending on when you downloaded terraform, you may have a different version than the "required_version = "~> 1.2.6" listed in the code snip you pasted into your main.tf file. If your version is different, update the code snippit to match your terraform version. In the image below we can see a version mismatch error.**

![image](/images/tfversion.PNG)

Next, run -

```
terraform init
```
This should initialize terraform in your local repository allowing you to execute terraform plan/apply commands against your local repo. 

We can now begin plotting our changes by executing: 
```
terraform plan
```
![image](/images/CXTFPlan.PNG)

This will give you a break down of what will be created, modified, or destroyed by running terraform apply. 

If everything looks good with the plan, you can probably guess what we're going to run next: 
```
terraform apply
```
You will need to confirm that you indeed want to make the changes so say "yes". 

![image](/images/CXTFApply.PNG)

At this point, you should be able to go into the org and see that your changes have been made! Congrats, you've successfully created a skill using CX as Code.

Now that we have configured a single object, we can move forward to more complex object creation involving dependencies. We will be adding a user to home division with the the skill we have already created. 

Below is a user constructional resource, many of the optional configuration components have been removed. We will copy this code snip and paste it within the main.tf file underneath the skill resource we created as your initial configuration. If you are using the workshop org, replace the digits in the email and name with your assigned number. If you are using your own org, make sure this information does not match an existing user.

```
resource "genesyscloud_user" "test_user" {
  email           = "workshop00@genesystest.com"
  name            = "Workshop 00"
  password        = "123Password!"
  state           = "inactive"
  acd_auto_answer = true
  division_id     = data.genesyscloud_auth_division.terraform.id
  routing_skills {
    skill_id    = genesyscloud_routing_skill.test_skill.id
    proficiency = 4.5
  }
  routing_utilization {
    call {
      maximum_capacity = 1
      include_non_acd  = true
    }
    callback {
      maximum_capacity          = 2
      include_non_acd           = false
      interruptible_media_types = ["call", "email"]
    }
    chat {
      maximum_capacity          = 3
      include_non_acd           = false
      interruptible_media_types = ["call"]
    }
    email {
      maximum_capacity          = 2
      include_non_acd           = false
      interruptible_media_types = ["call", "chat"]
    }
    video {
      maximum_capacity          = 1
      include_non_acd           = false
      interruptible_media_types = ["call"]
    }
    message {
      maximum_capacity          = 4
      include_non_acd           = false
      interruptible_media_types = ["call", "chat"]
    }
  }
}

```

Now, we can save and apply your terraform script and execute the change.

We will notice an error occur as shown below:

![image](/images/terraformerror.png)

The error tells us that we need to use a data source within the script identifying the division this plan is applying to. We will navigate **[here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/MyPureCloud/genesyscloud/latest/docs/data-sources/auth_division)** to find that data source.


Now we will copy and paste the division data source in order for our script to properly run.

>Note we have modified the Variable name to terraform to match our user resource, and we are searching for the "Home" Division by its name.

```
data "genesyscloud_auth_division" "terraform" {
  name = "home"
}
```
If you happened to run into the following error, we will want to run a refresh

![image](/images/terraformstateerror.png)


we perform a refresh in terraform by entering the following command in our terminal:

```
terraform refresh
```

This is is due to how Terraform logs information about the resources it has created in a state file. This enables Terraform to know which resources are under its control and when to update and destroy them. The terraform state file, by default, is named terraform.tfstate and is held in the same directory where Terraform is run. It is created after running terraform apply. The actual content of this file is a JSON formatted mapping of the resources defined in the configuration and those that exist in your infrastructure. When Terraform is run, it can then use this mapping to compare infrastructure to the code and make any adjustments as necessary.
