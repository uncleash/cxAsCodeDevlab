## Create a local file repository

This is fancy talk for creating a folder locally on your machine that will be used to store code and development projects.​

It is best practice to not include spaces in the name of this folder, or files in general while developing

## Open this folder within VSCode

You can either right click within this folder and select “Open with code” or navigate to it from VSCode Directly
